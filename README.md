# Gravitational Slingshot Motion

A Python program using the Pygame library to simulate gravitational slingshot motion of spacecraft around a planet.

## Introduction

This program demonstrates a basic physics simulation of a spacecraft's motion around a planet. It showcases gravitational forces acting on the spacecraft, allowing it to perform slingshot maneuvers around the planet.

## Features

- Gravitational interaction between a planet and a spacecraft.
- Spacecraft creation by specifying its initial position and velocity.
- Pygame-based visualization.

## Requirements

- Python (3.7+ recommended)
- Pygame library
